# Simulations folder Readme

This folder contains all the simulations I did and the files/scripts to calculates the associated quantifiers and 4 cell-arrays.

## Files ans folders explanations

### quantifiers.ipynb

This notebook calculates the quantifers as function of time or the area for the data text files in the format produced by **model.py** and saved them as numpy array files (.npy) in the. It is used mainly to calculates directy the quantifiers for a serie of data (example : the simu1)and saved them as numpy array files (.npy) in the corrsponding folder : in **quantifier_data** and **quantifier_data_area** for the data from simuc_data or in **method7/quantifier_data** and **method7/quantifier_data_area** for the data from **method7/simu_data**.

### 4cells.ipynb

Produces the 4 arrays images for the data  given to the corresponding function.

### Simuc_data folder

Contains the simulation files made with method4

### Quantifiers_data folder

Contains the quantifiers calculated in function of time with the files from **simuc_data**

### Quantifiers_data_area folder

Contains the quantifiers calculated in function of the area with the files from **simuc_data**

### method7 folder

Contains the simulation made with method7 and the quantifiers
