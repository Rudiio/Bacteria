# Modelisation of the morphogenesis of bacteria micro-colonies by considering a cell-spring individual based model.

## Introduction

This project consist in modeling the morphogenesis of micro-colonies of bacteria that support bending.
Our microscopic model is composed of spherical cells that are linked by springs.

## Simulation dimensions

The dimension for a bacteria is around 10 micrometers. On the display, it is possible to change the scale micrometer/pixel, but it is natively fixed to 1 um = 50 p
## TODO

- [X] Cell class
- [X] Bacterium class
- [X] App class
- [X] drawing axis
- [] drawing the cells
- [] drawing the bacteria
- [] compute spring/internal interaction
- [] bacteria movement

## Dependencies

The program relies on the Tkinter API for the GUI and on Numpy for the arrays and vector computations.

Tkinter is natively installed with Python 3

To install Numpy (with pip package  manager)

``` pip install numpy ```
