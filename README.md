# Modelisation of the morphogenesis of bacteria micro-colonies by considering a cell-spring individual based model.

## Introduction

This project consist in modeling the morphogenesis of micro-colonies of bacteria that support bending.
Our microscopic model is composed of disks that are linked by springs.

## Simulation dimensions

The dimension for a bacteria is around 10 micrometers. On the display, it is possible to change the scale micrometer/pixel, but it is natively fixed to 1 um = 40 p


## Commands
- **A** : show/hide the axises
- **K** : zoom
- **L** : dezoom
- **p** : take a screenshot
- **z** : generate a random bacterium
- **r** : change the display mode of the bacteria
- **← → ↑ ↓** : movements (change the origin)

## TODO

- [X] Cell class
- [X] Bacterium class
- [X] App class
- [X] drawing axis
- [X] drawing the cells
- [X] drawing the bacteria
- [ ] drawing the case of the bacteria
- [X] compute spring/internal interaction
- [ ] bacteria movement

## Dependencies

The program relies on the pygame API for the graphical interface and on Numpy for the arrays and vector computations. There is also a version using Tkinter but it not complete.

To install pygame (with pip package manager)

``` pip install pygame```

To install Numpy (with pip package manager)

``` pip install numpy ```
